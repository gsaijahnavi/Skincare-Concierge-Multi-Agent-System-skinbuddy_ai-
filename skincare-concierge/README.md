# Skincare Concierge

This repository contains a multi-agent system scaffold for a skincare concierge assistant. The layout includes agents, tools, a vector store placeholder, sample data, a small runner, and utility helpers.

Folder structure (created):
- agents/: agent implementations
- tools/: tool wrappers for search, product lookup, calendar, memory
- vector_store/: chroma DB placeholder
- data/: CSV sample data and user profile template
- app/: runner and routing/orchestration entry points
- utils/: embedding, text cleaning and validators

This is a scaffold with minimal implementations for development and testing.
